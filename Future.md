# Future:
Before you apply I must explain that I may or may not do this and if you apply for patreon, you will get the refund as the service has yet to start. The discord bot is not even verified and there isn't even an official server for it!

So I hate to do this, but writing and hosting Jasbot costs money + I am gonna donate the money that I may or may not make to charities.		
How does this work out? Ads are not targeted, meaning they are completely random. If you don't want ads, just host your own version of Jasbot. I don't intend to monetize this further. If you are interested to apply for ads when this bot get popular later, you can consider [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Pendragonscode/membership)
