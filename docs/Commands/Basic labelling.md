# Labling
If you run: `help celsius`, you would get this from the utilisation component: `celsius <temperature>`      
As you can see, when I use `<>` it means an argument can be put here.     
If this is used alongside with `/` like `<on/off>`, that means there is an argument that can be put here, but the argument will be either `on` or `off`.      

While there is some inconsistency with the utilisation sections and I would like to get that sorted out ASAP, there are somethings I need to settle first!
