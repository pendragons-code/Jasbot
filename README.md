# Explanation
Jasbot was originally a bot that I made a long time ago. And I have re-written this bot multiple times. This bot has been rewritten so many times that it is normal to hear me tell you that I am rewriting this bot.			
As of now, the older-improved instance of Jasbot is being hosted (basically legacy branch code with more code quality enhancements.). I have decided to include slash commands in this revision of Jasbot and therefor, development will take more time. Unlike the progress that I was able to make in the past, I have recently gotten a job and am unable to churn out the progress I once was able to. Worst of all, I will soon be starting my school term, which would mean that I would be unable to make more progress than I already am. There are more variables to account for in my current situation that is my time management than there are in my entire code for this repository.


# How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/jasbot -b master
npm i
npm update
npm run deploy
```

# Will REDO 
```
Basic code quality changes to some of the earlier files.
Major changes to the web server.
Moving away from weather-js and awaitig fixes for MAL-scraper.
```
# UPDATE

I will be redoing Jasbot. And for good reason. This entire time Jasbot has been in development and 50% of the time I used was pretty much used to solve and cause problems and the oter 50% was just wasted. I honestly got so out of touch with this project that when I saw the package.json file, I was shocked. Somehow pug, node-fetch, phin and a lot of packages that really don't have a need being there are there. Now imagine the actual code. I think you get the idea. It is also generally a good idea to redo it because the whole thing so far has been such a shitshow.
