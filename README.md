# the 7th rewrite

AHHH... How the duck DID I get here?! So as you know Jasbot has never used slash commands before. And in the early days, I knew slash commands would change discord api and bots in general forever. But I really disliked it for many reasons. While you can argue the menus and stuff are a lot more polished now, slash commands are still plagued by certain issues. That said I can also see some of the VERY DEV friendly parts.        
That said, I do not intend to remove message entry command completely. There are a few options to how I can do it based on what i have seen from the community.       

    1.) Create a folder for commands and slash commands, effectively rewriting the same command 2 times (easiest way if i did not want to rewrite, but not the most ethical method)                   
    2.) Just go full slash command and ignore the normal method.                  
    3.) somehow combine both (apparently some people managed to do this, I just can't find them on github)                        

That said im not a hater of the idea, I just much prefer the older way as I could easily copy and paste commands with less hassle. While my unhappiness is present, it is insignificant to the advantages brought by it.
