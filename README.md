# rewrite
Im rewriting this bot from scratch, the fourth time.			
So expect the progress from the other branch to have literally nothing going on!				
Bot will not be hosted with the new version and will still go on with the older version!
# history
I originally wrote Jasbot in 2019, with discord v11 or/and v12. I left this bot sitting at one corner of my computer and completely forgot about it. I found this project again, made this thing from scratch along with a new account. When I say from scratch it was kinda just rewriting and putting in the new stuff and updating event and command handlers. So that actually led into bad code writing and having only written smaller projects, I never thought about writing this thing seriously. But now, I'm a 16 yo that am considering higher education in a programming world. While I am still in conflict if I want to, I may or may not still end up in this world. After some back and forth I decided, "What the hell! What is the harm spending the time of my holidays on stuff like that."
