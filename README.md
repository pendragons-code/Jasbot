# Explanation
Jasbot was originally a bot that I made a long time ago. And I have re-written this bot multiple times. This bot has been rewritten so many times that it is normal to hear me tell you that I am rewriting this bot.			
As of now, the older-improved instance of Jasbot is being hosted (basically legacy branch code with more code quality enhancements.). I have decided to include slash commands in this revision of Jasbot and therefor, development will take more time. Unlike the progress that I was able to make in the past, I have recently gotten a job and am unable to churn out the progress I once was able to. Worst of all, I will soon be starting my school term, which would mean that I would be unable to make more progress than I already am. There are more variables to account for in my current situation that is my time management than there are in my entire code for this repository.
