# Jasbot
A poorly designed version of Jasbot.    
Not fully done! come back later!!   

clone the repo    
```
git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/Jasbot
```

get into the directory and install all the packages   
```
npm i && npm update
```

have fun because i requested for it. (make a .env file, define token in there and start the runtime)    


lol yeah i was too lazy to make the console.log thing in bot.js look better and i know using multiple console.logs is not the smartest (too lazy to microoptimize everything) but whatever bro!
Should consider something like eslint...        
    As of now, I do not care about what you may choose to do with such terrible code written by myself.
    This might change depending on how things goes.

# db
I chose quick.db since it was quick and advance + it was really good for what I needed. If I for some reason chose to use mongo.db it ght have been overkill not gonna lie.


I, however, might consider the usage of encrypted DBs

# Resuming work on:
So surprising no one, i am a student with exams and therefor will not be in contact with this repo for a long time, expect the next commit to be late october.
```
[.] basic commands and stuff.
[.] sharding.
[.] is just a terrible prototype and improvements will be made.

# advertising

Yes i will be advertising with this bot, i will be implementing some basic advertising in the server and the bot.       
Why am i doing this?
1.) Personal gain, I will be honest, i am just a kid who got out of high school, i would like to prepare for the next level of educations
2.) [Also this](https://help.unicef.org/?country=SG&gclid=Cj0KCQjw08aYBhDlARIsAA_gb0dKglzLKjs81QBdnLsIzXmEo8CxFeT_nLeL-4XE9jgDJ6eX3Biw-b4aAv8CEALw_wcB), many people think i'm doing this for a PR stunt. Ok yes, technically this is. But I would like to say that I have been supporting the open source education movement for a long time and would like to continue doing so by providing financial and cheaper stuff for children around the world. Many people ask how making tiny projects like this would help people and I understand that my output as of now is very little. I would like to emphasize that i will increase the stuff i put online to help people learn in the future.
