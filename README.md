# Explanation:
Jasbot was originally a bot that I made a long time ago. And I have re-written this bot multiple times. This bot has been rewritten so many times that it is normal to hear me tell you that I am rewriting this bot.			
As of now, the older-improved instance of Jasbot is being hosted (basically legacy branch code with more code quality enhancements.). I have decided to include slash commands in this revision of Jasbot and therefor, development will take more time. Unlike the progress that I was able to make in the past, I have recently gotten a job and am unable to churn out the progress I once was able to. Worst of all, I will soon be starting my school term, which would mean that I would be unable to make more progress than I already am. There are more variables to account for in my current situation that is my time management than there are in my entire code for this repository.

# Apologies:
I promised a good bot and I failed to deliver. And so now I will pop in and around. I will probably run this bot on a donation for uptime basis. The idea here is that instead of pushing the bot's payment for uptime via the means of monetizing the bot itself, such as locking down features. I would proably elect to use advertisments and patreon to make a bot that allows the features to be use by all people.

# Future plans:
I hope to be able to make a discord bot that is good and helpful when it comes to usage. So yeah! A little too ambitious for my current plight. However, there is nothing that I can do about my current situation.

# How to use:
```
git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/jasbot -b master
npm i
npm update
npm run deploy
```

# Temporarily delaying:
I will be moving away from weather-js

# Code Format and Quality
It would seem that one of my commits to this repo had cause code to be rolled back, reducing the quality. I am trying to resolve this issue as of now. Last but not least, my linting configuration was also broken along the way and it conflicts with the extension I use for VSC and codium's format structure (As of neovim the thing is not working consistently.). Because of this broken configurations of both ends and conflicting extensions, weird stuff has appeared and I will be trying to fix them first.
