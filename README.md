# Explanation:
Jasbot was originally a bot that I made a long time ago. And I have re-written this bot multiple times. This bot has been rewritten so many times that it is normal to hear me tell you that I am rewriting this bot.			
As of now, the older-improved instance of Jasbot is being hosted (basically legacy branch code with more code quality enhancements.). I have decided to include slash commands in this revision of Jasbot and therefor, development will take more time. Unlike the progress that I was able to make in the past, I have recently gotten a job and am unable to churn out the progress I once was able to. Worst of all, I will soon be starting my school term, which would mean that I would be unable to make more progress than I already am. There are more variables to account for in my current situation that is my time management than there are in my entire code for this repository.

# Apologies:
I promised a good bot and I failed to deliver. And so now I will pop in and around. I will probably run this bot on a donation for uptime basis. The idea here is that instead of pushing the bot's payment for uptime via the means of monetizing the bot itself, such as locking down features. I would proably elect to use advertisments and patreon to make a bot that allows the features to be use by all people.

# Future plans:
I hope to be able to make a discord bot that is good and helpful when it comes to usage. So yeah! A little too ambitious for my current plight. However, there is nothing that I can do about my current situation.
