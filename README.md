# Jasbot
A poorly designed version of Jasbot.    
Not fully done! come back later!!   

clone the repo    
```
git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/Jasbot
```

get into the directory and install all the packages   
```
npm i
```

have fun because i requested for it. (make a .env file, define token in there and start the runtime)    


lol yeah i was too lazy to make the console.log thing in bot.js look better and i know using multiple console.logs is not the smartest (too lazy to microoptimize everything) but whatever bro!
Should consider something like eslint...        
    As of now, I do not care about what you may choose to do with such terrible code written by myself.
    This might change depending on how things goes.
# extra
If you are wondering why all the details with regards to the site in the config files are kinda weird, I have actually bought the domain, but have not yet set up the site.
# db
I chose quick.db since it was quick and advance + it was really good for what I needed. If I for some reason chose to use mongo.db it ght have been overkill not gonna lie.
